               I was very curious to know how come the web page is created and is available all over the world in a single click. Well to get the answer I had to deep dive in to the world of computer science.  Now  I am overwhelmed to publish a very basic web page which can be viewed all over the internet. I sincerely thank  to <a href="https://www.traversymedia.com/" target="_blank">traversyMedia</a>, <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freecodeCamp</a> , <a href="https://academind.com/" target="_blank">academind</a> , <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3school</a> , <a href="http://www.telusko.com/" target="_blank">telusko.com</a>  and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">udemy.com</a> for their great online tutorials. More over other various youtube tutorials and <a href="https://www.linux.org/forums/linux-beginner-tutorials.123/" target="_blank"> the linux basics</a> helped me a lot to accomplish my dream. Actually while following a course on AWS cloud practitioners, prompted me to jump directly in to web page publishing. I found my dream realised. I found that pursuing those basic languages are prerequisite for web and app develoment.  A brief introduction of Amazon web services follows in my next blog.<br> Thanks from <em>myfirstblogspot </em>   for visiting the site.<br> Click next color strip to view more  --></h3>
