    <h3>Core concept</h3>
    <div>In a traditional IT environment, all the physical components required to run your systems are owned, operated,
      maintained, and housed on-premises. However, hardware requires a large up-front investment to procure and
      continual expense and effort to maintain. The cost, complexity, and time required to expand or alter an
      on-premises infrastructure can slow or even stop you from experimenting with new processes or systems.<br>Amazon
      Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully
      featured services from data centers globally. If you are a developer new to AWS, this is where you can learn to
      build applications on AWS. Choose the programming language and tools familiar to you, learn about core concepts
      applicable across any service you end up using, and then go build!Passionate learners and site builder includes a
      wide spectrum of customers, ranging from any individual working on a side project, to a blogger creating a
      personal website, to a web pro building websites. Hobbyist builders are passionate about their projects, but don't
      want to worry about cloud management. AWS enables hobbyist builders to focus on their applications, and leave the
      cloud management to us. This group belongs to those who want to get started in the cloud in the fastest, easiest,
      and cheapest way possible.The Five Pillars covered in the AWS Fundamentals Course come from the AWS

      <h3>Courses on Amazon Web Services and WordPress</h3>
      <div>The present blog was started with a view to share my experience with Amazone Web Services, how it catapulted
        my
        ability to publish my own web page. <br> Amazon Web Services (AWS) is all about cloud computing.What Is Cloud
        Computing?
        Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of information technology (IT) resources via the Internet with
        pay-as-you-go pricing model. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining your own data centers and servers,
        organizations can acquire technology such as compute power, storage, databases, and other services on an
        as-needed
        basis.<br>We will start over again covering basics of AWS in this blog from next week. I wish to share the link
        of
        amazon documentation <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html">here</a> for those eager to jump in to the
        ocean of information. <br>AWS is a plateform to deliver your contents to the internet. The contents it self can
        be
        made presentable using WordPress in a user friendly manner. So we will also be refreshing our knowledge of
        building attractive web sites using WordPress. </div>
      <h3>Cancellation of Class XII<small>th</small> examination</h3>
      <div>Government had taken right decision by cancelling the class 12th examinations, although that will mean
        considerably limited opportunities for students. Hopes of normal academic session, after the traumatic
        experience
        of students all through last year, have been dashed by the emergence of the double mutant variant of the
        coronavirus that has spread far and wide because of various reasons. Every one was obviously anxious to see
        Government as acting decisively on the examination question, after a long phase of dithering in formulating a
        national response. The decision to cancel the crucial Class XII public examination and replace it with an
        objective assessment for certification will help boards of education in the States to move in the same
        direction.
        The Board must now come up with a model scientific scheme of future and device an examination system .<br>Its
        the
        time to think and implement the concept of digital India in education system and examinations by thoughtful
        planning. Building an infrastucture inline with IGNOU is not a bad idea so that unpredictable natural and other
        dasater may have minimum effect on future of young India </div>

      <h3>Timely action to take care of orphaned children </h3>
      <div>There are numerous after affect of the pandemic being felt by society. Some of them are such that require
        immediate attention. Taking care of orphaned children is one of the area which need immediate attention before
        it
        is too late. Goverment has already started action to identify such children. It is also reported that the cause
        of
        death of the parents are not recorded in many instances which may cause delay in providing assistance. Goverment
        should take action so that lack of record may not come in the way in providing shelter food and protection to
        such
        ill fated children</div>
      <h3>Need for a new normal in India</h3>
      <div>After touching a high of more than 4 lac corona cases per day about a month ago now the cases per day has
        come
        down to less than 50,000 gives some respite. While country is still fighting to defeat corona and vaccination
        drive has been initiated some parts of the country is seeing a stern resistance against vaccination specially in
        rural areas. Multipronged action is needed. To further accelerate the vaccination in all corners of thecountry
        in.
        The mamoth task of this dimension can not be done by Government alone. All political parties, relegious leaders,
        Scientists, Industrialists, NGOs, should come forward and make concerted effort to cope up with the situation.

      <h2>PROSPECTS OF HORTICULTURE IN INDIA</h2>
      <p id="hindi">
        <bold>Horticulture is made up of two words Hortus + Cultura, which means garden agriculture. <br>

          <ul>
            <h4>The ambit of agriculture is big.</h4>
            <li>Pomiculture (Fruits)</li>
            <li>Olericulture (Vegetables)</li>
            <li>Ornamental (Flower)</li>
            <li>Landscaping</li>
            <li>Arboriculture (Trees)</li>
          </ul>
          India is 2<small>nd</small> largest horticulture producing country. Many of the products are top produce in
          the
          world.<br>
          There are many cause and factors for such growth and market.<div>
            <p>1- Cheap and ample manpower:<br> The vegetable and fruit require a lot of manpower to carefully plant and
              manage the produce.</p>
            <p>Various Govt schemes supplementing horticulture<br> National horticulture mission (NHM) under mission for
              Integrated Development of Horticulture has propelled the growthof horticultureproduce like
              anything<br>Continuous growth of area vide Horticulture, Horticultural foodgrain production (for 2018-2019
              data)</p>
            <p>High yield:area ratio<br>
              High yield to area ratio for the horticulture produces attracts many farmers</p>
            <p>High export value: Horticulture product are of high cultural value exported to countries like UAE,
              Bangladesh etc.
            <p>Multipurpose usage<br>Apart from local dietory usage the horticulture produce is used in many places like
            <ul>
              <li>Food processing</li>
              <li>Perfume and cosmetics</li>
              <li>Pharma companies</li>
            </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Problems of horticulture</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Lack of Storage <br>Horticulture produce are perishable and readily rotten hence proper storage with cold
            storage facility is necessary. Timely transportation of the produce from cold storage to villages and market
            .Agri-food supply chains and networks play an important role in providing producers access to markets; they
            affect economic, social and environmental sustainability of rural communities. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Variety of horticulture produce<br> The variety and popularity is not as much as food grains.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Incessant use of fertilizers and pesticides<br>Natural and ZB farming still has few takers in Indian
            farming
            community</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <P>Still horticulture has to get traction in India, as much as foodgrains, specially when India has challenges
      against
      malnutrition. Mission like "Mission Position by Go I" should also integtate sensitizing of farmers as well as
      consumers to balance both demand and supply. Enhancing small farm productivity, and
      increasing small farm income through crop-livestock integrated production systems and multiple livelihood
      opportunities through agro-processing and biomass
      utilization, are essential both to meet food production targets and for reducing hunger, poverty and rural
      unemployment. </P>
